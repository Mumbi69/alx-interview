# Pascal's Triangle
* Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical pattern of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. For example, the third number in a row is the sum of the two numbers above it in the previous row.
* The pascal_triangle function takes a number n as input and generates Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row. The function returns the triangle as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's Triangle.
* The print_triangle function is a helper function to display the generated Pascal's Triangle in a readable format.
