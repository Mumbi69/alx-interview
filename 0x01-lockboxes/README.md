# Lockboxes
* This implementation uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to traverse through the boxes and check if all of them can be opened starting from the first box (index 0). The set opened_boxes keeps track of the boxes that have been opened, and the queue is used for BFS traversal. The function returns True if all boxes can be opened and False otherwise.
